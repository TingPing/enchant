libenchant -- Generic spell checking library
Original author: Dom Lachowicz

libenchant is licensed under the terms of the GNU LGPL (see the file
COPYING.LIB), with a special exception allowing the use of proprietary
spell-checking systems.

Enchant aims to provide a simple but comprehensive abstraction for dealing
with different spell checking libraries in a consistent way. A client, such
as a text editor or word processor, need not know anything about a specific
spell-checker, and since all back-ends are plugins, new spell-checkers can
be added without needing any change to the program using Enchant.

Enchant can be configured by the user, who can even add spell-checker
plugins if desired.

Enchant currently works with the following spell-checkers:

    * Hunspell (formerly Myspell)
    * GNU Aspell
    * GNU Ispell[1]
    * Hspell
    * Voikko
    * Apple Spell (macOS only)
    * Zemberek
    * Uspell

Enchant is written in C and C++, and its only external dependency is glib.

[1] Enchant contains a version of Ispell built as a library, which enables
it to use Ispell dictionaries.
